<p>
    Curiefense is now in GA! üéâ The <a href="https://docs.curiefense.io/v/1.3.0/installation/getting-started-with-curiefense">latest version</a> (1.3.0) is now available for deployment. A lot has happened since the initial release of v1.0
    in November, and not just in <a href="https://docs.curiefense.io/v/1.3.0/reference/release-notes">our changelog</a>. Here are some of the highlights.
</p>
<h3>Joining the Open Source and Cloud Native Communities</h3>
<p>
    Curiefense is now a <a href="https://www.curiefense.io/post/now-a-cncf-sandbox-project">CNCF Sandbox Project</a>, and we‚Äôre already making substantial progress in conforming the project to CNCF standards.&nbsp;
    <br />
</p>
<p>
    The project has <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/4576">earned the CII Best Practices Badge</a> from the Linux Foundation.
    <br />
</p>
<p>
    We have launched a podcast: ‚Äú <a href="https://ctcn.fireside.fm/1">Committing to Cloud Native</a>.‚Äù Along with discussing news and current events in the community, we‚Äôll be documenting our journey as we integrate Curiefense into the
    cloud native ecosystem. Hopefully, the lessons we learn along the way can be useful to others who travel this path later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>New Interactive Learning Platform</h3>
<p>
    Now you can try Curiefense without having to install anything. Our <a href="https://www.katacoda.com/curiefense/scenarios/getting-started">first scenario on Katacoda</a> provides you with a live, remotely-accessible environment, and
    walks you through Curiefense‚Äôs initial deployment, management UI, and dashboards. More scenarios are on the way. Be sure to check out our short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkoDPW46a8I">explainer video</a>.
</p>
<h3>Project Transparency and Community Participation</h3>
<p>
    Curiefense has been an ‚Äúopen book‚Äù project from day one, and we‚Äôre continuing to make data even easier to access. Recently we have:
    <br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Created a
        <a href="https://app.databox.com/datawall/3ddf913b2db3bb4f53586ec27aaee63106008ba72">GitHub Dashboard by Databox</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Added
        <a href="https://curiefense.devstats.cncf.io/d/8/dashboards?orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now-1h&refresh=15m">activity reporting via CNCF DevStats</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Created multiple granular channels in the Curiefense Slack workspace, making it easier to follow and participate in specific parts in the project. Slack members can interact with project maintainers, and can also subscribe to our
        realtime GitHub repository feed.
    </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>
    To celebrate our launch, we now have <a href="https://github.com/curiefense/media/blob/main/README.md#-wallpaper">Curiefense wallpaper</a> available for your
    <a href="https://github.com/curiefense/media/blob/main/README.md#-wallpaper">desktop</a> and/or <a href="https://github.com/curiefense/media/blob/main/README.md#-zoom-virtual-backgrounds">Zoom</a>. Stay tuned for shirts and stickers,
    coming soon!
</p>
<h2>All Are Welcome!</h2>
<p>
    Curiefense is maintained by <a href="https://www.reblaze.com/">Reblaze</a>, which is making significant investments into its development. That being said, Curiefense is a CNCF project, and is vendor-neutral.&nbsp;
    <br />
</p>
<p>
    We ask anyone who is interested to join us (including competitors). Our goal is to provide the community with a robust cloud native security solution for Envoy Proxy, and all are welcome. The more we work together, the better it will be
    for everyone.
